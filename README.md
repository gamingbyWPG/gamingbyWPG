# 👋 Welcome to the Official GitHub of gamingbyWPG!

🎮 This is the official GitHub for my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@gamingbyWPG), where I share **performance tweaks**, **FPS boosters**, and **fixes** for popular games—specially made for **low-end** and **mid-end PCs**.

🔧 **What you'll find here:**
- 🎮 Game-specific configuration packs.
- 🚫 Crash and bug fixes.
- 🚀 Tweaks to boost FPS and reduce lag.
- 📁 Easy-to-use files with clear instructions.

## 📂 Folder Naming Conventions:
- **`_config`**: These contain **tweaks, optimizations, and FPS boost settings** to improve performance on **low-end or mid-end PCs**. Think of them as "lag fix" or "performance boost" packs.
- **`_fix`**: These address **specific game issues**, such as **crashes, bugs, resolution problems**, or other in-game errors.

Each folder is game-specific and labeled accordingly.
